## Introduction
This code is a Solidity contract for a token called "EverCoin" with the abbreviation "EVR". It includes a few functions for minting and burning tokens.
The contract starts with public variables, such as "tokenName" set to "EverCoin", "tokenAbbrv" set to "EVR", and "totalSupply" set to 0.
Next, there is a mapping variable called "balances" that maps addresses to token balances.
The contract includes a "mint" function that takes an address and a value as parameters. This function increases the total supply by the given value and adds the value to the balance of the specified address.
Similarly, there is a "burn" function that takes an address and a value as parameters. This function decreases the total supply by the given value and subtracts the value from the balance of the specified address, but only if the address has enough tokens.

## Code Explanation
This Solidity smart contract named MyToken represents a basic token contract with minting and burning functionalities. Here is an explanation of the key components of the contract:

Contract Overview:
Name: MyToken
Token Name: EverCoin
Token Abbreviation: EVR
Total Supply: Initialized to 0

Public Variables:
tokenName: A public string variable representing the name of the token, set to "EverCoin".
tokenAbbrv: A public string variable representing the abbreviation of the token, set to "EVR".
totalSupply: A public uint variable representing the total token supply, initialized to 0.

Mapping Variable:
balances: A mapping that associates addresses with their token balances. It maps addresses to the amount of tokens they hold.

Functions:
mint Function:
Parameters: _address (address), _value (uint)
Functionality: Increases the total supply by _value and adds _value tokens to the balance of {insert\_element\_0\_X2FkZHJlc3M=}.
burn Function:
Parameters: _address (address), _value (uint)
Functionality: Checks if _address has sufficient tokens, then decreases the total supply by _value and reduces _value tokens from the balance of _address.
